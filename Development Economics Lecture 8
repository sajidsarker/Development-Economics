Development Economics: Lecture 8

#Summary of (6) RCTs
*Take up low
*If we thought microcredit was a panacea, then take up should have been higher
*Microcredit isn't bad, but people aren't flooding to it
*Take up is not predictive by observables
*Not easy to deal with selection given observables
*Measures of entrepreneurial ability not easy and is an econometric issue
*Tables give average effects
**How much on average does consumption in village change given access to credit
**But this masks a lot of heterogeneities
*Lack of transformative effects on average borrowers (Not a null effect; CI doesn't include those effects)
*Not for lack of trying
*Investment in business growth evidence does exist
**Take loan and invest in business profitable in short term
*Not large differences in control and treatment many years out
*Modest but potentially important effects did persist
**Modest consumption gains
**Short term business improvements
*Important from policy standpoint; There was brushback from microcredit critics
*How can it be made worse off?
**Choices taken which have worse payoffs in the long term
**Why freely chosen decision makes them worse off?
**General Equilibrium story: Risk-sharing mechanism collapses
**Leads to adverse impacts like greater indebtedness, productivity
*Some hints of transformative effects for some

#Important Caveat
*Who is the sample targeted RCT?
*Potential new customers
**Perhaps current customers already be the ones with highest returns
**Effects on marginal people not the same as those who really want to borrow (have fantastic idea)
*Unobserved heterogeneity would make it hard to disentagle from selection in
*Andhra Pradesh shut down microcredit
**Indebted farmers committed suicide
**Was microcredit the proximate cause?
*The authors noticed that not just in comparing that state, but also microcredit found in AP but worked on outside the state
**DID conducted due to this being a big enough shock and possible to look at equilibrium change
*Houses consuming less
*Productivity negatively impacted
*Margins not as big of an impact but those selecting in can have big benefits

#Potential heterogeneity in returns important
*Beaman et al (2015) Study selection into credit markets by comparing returns to capital who endog chose to borrow with those exp. provided capital
*Those who chose to borrow have high returns to capital
*These returns not predicted by observables
*Banerjee et al (2015) 6 years after MF RCT in India, find benefits among entrepreneurs who had already started were still significantly benefitting (from previous paper)
*SR some evidence of transformative effects
*LR there was persistence of this
**Only way to identify themselves is by looking at their behaviour given revealed preferences of different rates imposed
*Savings as a puzzle, why don't households save enough?
*If you are risk averse and income fluctuates, then you would rather smooth consumption
*Given high marginal productivity of capital why aren't farmers saving huge amounts?
*Costs associated with it, risk sharing discourages savings; if you're doing well others want stake in it
*When life is hard, harder to postpone gratification
*Difficult to choose what to save in, when it's an environment for example inflation being high, better to save in durables


#Perfect Property Rights Benchmark
*Universality
**All resources privately owned
*Exclusivity
**Possible to prevent others from using privately owned resources
*Transferability
**Owner of the resource may sell the resource when desired
**Implicitly allows other transactions (mortgages, gifts)
**Underlying transaction forms can manifest
*Enforceability
**Market overlayed on top of property rights
**Market distribution provides some return to the resource
**Market distribution based on benefits of the resource must be enforceable

*If so, Coase theorem applies
*Provided Transaction Costs Low
*Use of resource is socially efficient


Udry Ghana 2015
Gender within household affects productivity
What is the impact of land rights on agricultural investment?
Without rights to return, unwilling to invest
*Fear of expropriation
*
*

Past papers fail to find significant effect of property rights on investment
How do lang rights influence agricultural investment?

#Land rights
*Owned by a chief
**Allocated to individuals for use
**Taken away at anytime if fail to use effectively
**Matrilineage
**Hierarchical position closely related to security and tenure rights

*Those who hold office have higher confidence on land rights
*2 year rural survey of 4 villages of 60 couples taken 15 times over 2 years

*Agricultural investment
**Fallow (left for a period to restore fertility)
*This is the investment to increase productivity
**No fertiliser is used

*Claim
**Investment => Higher Output (proved by soil science)

*Dilemma
**Uncultivated land has higher output
**Tradeoff with loss of right to use land as a risk

*Model
**Maximise present value of future profits
If two plots are similarly securely held (prob of loss is equal) ...

*Hierarchical indicaors (omega tenure security) serves as instrument of tau (fallow duration)
Prelim: Hierarchical position influences seccurity of tenure (longer fallow)
Difference within couples ...


Alternatives
Cannot reject within hh allocation is inefficient
(bargaining within)

Office holder
*Likelier to leave land fallow 2y longer
*Less confident in commercially obtained land: Buying from marketing is less secure than matrilineage

No differences in land security outside HH
